What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git adds a .git file that contains all the meta-data for the repository.  You need to have git installed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a place where you can think about and arrange what you
want to include in a commit.  It forces you to think about the commit a bit
more.
