When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I could access the code from any computer.  I could also collaborate on the 
code with others and have them push and pull.  I could also edit the code online
and then pull it to my machine.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might not want other people's developments on your computer.  Also,
you might not want the main version if you are working on an experimental
feature.



Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

You can clone a repository from GitHub to your own computer.  You can also
clone a repository from your own computer to another location on your
own computer.  A fork clones a GitHub repository to another location on
the GitHub servers and saves it as a new repository that is owned by the
forker.  A branch is a commit that starts a new label and branch of the
commit tree.
